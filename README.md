Machine learning consists of integrating a certain amount of data into an artificial intelligence, and letting it find, autonomously, the best way to process it.

In this specific case of "self-dubbing", an actor specializing in dubbing would be hired to speak for a few minutes in his own language, thus giving the machine a basis for work. The latter will then learn to reproduce the voice, make sentences, then adapt it to a script before including everything in a film or series.

Unlike the traditional process, where the actors enact each line of script, and taking several months of work, this process, described by the Post, should only last a few weeks.
